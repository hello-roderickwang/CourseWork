\begin{abstract}
\textnormal{
In our daily life, we always try to find the optimal route to save time and energy. That is why GPS navigator is necessary when travelling. There is so-called classical travelling salesman problem (TSP) discussing how to find the optimal route that include all vertices once and finally goes back to the starting point. Sometimes, however, not only do we consider the distance cost, we might even care more about the energy cost coming from the mass that is carried. For example, a UPS driver needs to consider the total mass of packages on the truck as well as the distance of different routes. That is why in this paper we try to modify the TSP algorithm so that it can be applied on a model in which not only edges but also vertices themselves are weighted.

\textnormal{
In this paper, we modify TSM algorithms for real life applications. The model used here is undirected, connected, weighted graph. All the edges are weighted positively(representing distance). Also vertices are weighted as well. The weight at each vertex could be positive or negative depending on different situations. In garbage collection, for example, the weight will be the mass of garbage collected at each location and is positve. For delivery men, on the other hand, the weight will then be the mass of packages delivered to each location and is negative. Our purpose is to find the optimal route to visit all vertices considering the weight of both vertices and edges. The main difference from original weighted graph is that, the weight of edges only adds into the cost when edges are visited. But the weight of vertices defined in this project will continuously raise the total cost during the rest of tour. This project can be used in real life to save the cost of garbage collection, package delivery, etc. This is a NP-Hard problem and it's not easy for un-highly-educated man to solve and that's the value of out project, which is help to solve this complicate problem by simply need user provide basic information like how far from A to B and what's the weight of P1. The outcome of this project will not need any basic of computer and simple typing skill will do.
